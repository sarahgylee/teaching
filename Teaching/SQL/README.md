# SQL for Business Intelligence Instructional Module

### Module Overview
I developed this instructional curriculum to provide a comprehensive introduction to SQL as a foundational tool for data extraction and business intelligence. The material focuses on transforming raw relational data into actionable insights through structured querying techniques within the University of Toronto analytics program.

### Core Technical Competencies

* **Data Selection and Field Identification**
Instruction on using SELECT statements to isolate specific variables for targeted analysis.
* **Conditional Filtering and Logic**
Practical labs on utilizing WHERE clauses to segment records based on precise business criteria.
* **Data Organization and Sorting**
Advanced modules on ordering result sets alphabetically or numerically to identify top performers.
* **Aggregation and Statistical Summarization**
Technical instruction on using GROUP BY and aggregate functions to calculate averages and other summary metrics.
* **Relational Data Integration**
Complex exercises on joining multiple tables using JOIN clauses to synthesize disparate data sources into a unified analytical view.

### Case Study Student Performance Analytics
The module includes a series of strategic querying challenges based on a Harry Potter themed dataset where students evaluate academic achievement across various metrics.

* **Database Schema and Resource**

### Analytical Query Solutions
The repository features practical solutions for common business intelligence requests.
* **Segmented Data Retrieval**: Selecting specific performance attributes from the student population.
* **Categorical Filtering**: Identifying specific subsets of data based on organizational codes.
* **Trend Sorting**: Organizing records to identify pass or fail distributions.
* **Metric Averaging**: Calculating precise performance averages for school house groups.
* **Table Synthesis**: Integrating student and school tables to provide a comprehensive view of educational outcomes.

### Instructional Leadership
Designing these SQL modules required deep technical expertise combined with the ability to articulate complex database logic to students. This repository highlights my background as an Analytics Instructor and my proficiency in managing relational database systems to drive business value.
